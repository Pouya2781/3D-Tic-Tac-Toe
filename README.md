# 3D Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to 3D Tic Tac Toe! This is an interactive version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, but with a 3D twist. Instead of the usual 3x3 grid, you'll play on a 3D cube. To win, you need to create two lines of the same shape across any direction!

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `3D_Tic_Tac_Toe.html` file in your favorite web browser.
3. To make a move, click on any available square on the 3D cube.
4. You can rotate the cube to view it from different angles using the provided rotation buttons.
5. If you want to place your shape in the middle of the cube, press the shift key on your keyboard and then click on the middle square.

## AI Opponent

This game features an AI opponent that utilizes the Minimax algorithm to make its moves. The AI will search up to a depth of 5 to find the best move, so be patient if it takes a while for the AI to make its decision.

## Dependencies

This project uses the `three.min.js` library to handle the 3D rendering. Make sure to include it along with the `3D_Tic_Tac_Toe.html` file.
